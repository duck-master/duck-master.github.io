            <p>*The Leahy calendar, proposed in December 1974 by Francis Leahy, would agree with the Gregorian calendar in October 1582, but instead skip a leap year when the year number is a multiple of 128. Currently the Gregorian and Leahy calendar agree, but they are set to diverge in 2048.</p>
