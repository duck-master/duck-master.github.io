                <p>I created this website using the code editor <a href = "https://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>. I personally wrote all of the HTML and CSS code myself. This website is hosted by <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
                <p>My tech stack:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brackets v2.0.1</li>
                    <li>macOS* Monterey v12.0.1</li>
                    <li>Apple Safari** v15.1 + Firefox v95.0.2 + Google Chrome v97.0.4692.71</li>
                </ul>
                <p>*I may switch to (some distribution of) Linux in the future.</p>
                <p>**I've tested this website in Safari and Chrome, but it should display correctly in all browsers. I currently mainly use Safari, but may switch to Firefox. </p>

                <p>Feel free to use the content on this website as you wish; I generally have a fairly <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude towards copyright, especially w.r.t. stuff I create.</p>
