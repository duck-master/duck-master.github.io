                    <li><strong>I am not a lawyer</strong>, and this document is not legal advice. I don't really know how documents like this are supposed to work, so some or all of this document may be invalid. For legal advice, please ask a real lawyer. </li>
                    <li>As of the date of last update (displayed at the bottom of the page), I am legally a <strong>minor</strong>, which means that I cannot enter into legal contracts. However, you may consider this an ethical contract. I will remove this disclaimer after I am no longer a minor.</li>
