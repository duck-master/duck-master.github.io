            <p> Last updated 27 February 2021 AD/CE (Gregorian/Leahy* calendar)</p>
            <p> (Informal and possibly unenforceable) legal/terms/conditions/privacy stuff is here.</p>
            <p>*The Leahy calendar, proposed in December 1974 by Francis Leahy, would agree with the Gregorian calendar in October 1582, but instead skip a leap year when the year number is a multiple of 128. Currently the Gregorian and Leahy calendar agree, but they are set to diverge in 2048.</p>
