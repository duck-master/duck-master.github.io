# About #

This GitHub repository is for my official personal website. It is hosted by GitHub Pages and is live at [https://duck-master.github.io](https://duck-master.github.io).

# Tech stack and file structure #

(As of August 26, 2024.)

This website is implemented solely using *raw HTML/CSS* (there is no JavaScript), every line of which I have personally handcrafted. Web frameworks are overrated.

The file structure is as follows:

* `.gitignore`
* `README.md` (this very file!)
* `LICENSE` (a standard MIT license)
* `index.html`
* `about.html`
* `about-me.html`
* `legal-etc.html`
* `404.html`
* `main.css`
* `avatar.png`
* `favicons`
  * `android-chrome-192x192.png`
  * `android-chrome-512x512.png`
  * `apple-touch-icon.png`
  * `favicon-16x16.png`
  * `favicon-32x32.png`
  * `favicon.ico`
  * `site.webmanifest`
* `robots.txt`
* `sitemap.xml`

# Contributing #

If you want to contribute to my personal website, there are three different ways:

* Make a **pull request**.
* **Open an issue** on this very GitHub repository.
* Email me at **[duckmaster0@protonmail.com](mailto:duckmaster0@protonmail.com)** and ask me to fix the issue myself.

Do note that this repo *is* my personal website, so I may reject suggestions more harshly than with more code-centric projects.

To reduce legal headaches, please agree to also release your contribution(s) under both MIT and CC-BY 4.0.
